Losses are principally limited to the owner’s property. 2. SIGNIFICANT HAZARD POTENTIAL Dams assigned the significant hazard potential classification are those dams where failure or mis-operation results in no probable loss of human life but can cause economic loss, environment damage, disruption of lifeline facilities, or impact other concerns. Significant hazard potential classification dams are often located in predominantly rural or agricultural areas but could be located in areas with population and significant infrastructure. 3. HIGH HAZARD POTENTIAL Dams assigned the high hazard potential classification are those where failure or mis- operation will probably cause loss of human life. Hazard Potential Loss of Human Life Economic, Environmental, Lifeline Losses Classification Low None expected Low and generally limited to owner Significant None expected Yes High Probable. One or more Yes (but not necessary for this expected classification) 4. UNDETERMINED HAZARD POTENTIAL Dams for which a downstream hazard potential, as defined in 1-3 above, has not been designated or is not provided.

Acceptable performance is expected under all loading conditions (static, hydrologic, seismic) in accordance with the applicable regulatory criteria or tolerable risk guidelines. 2. FAIR No existing dam safety deficiencies are recognized for normal loading conditions. Rare or extreme hydrologic and/or seismic events may result in a dam safety deficiency. Risk may be in the range to take further action. 3. POOR A dam safety deficiency is recognized for loading conditions which may realistically occur. Remedial action is necessary. POOR may also be used when uncertainties exist as to critical analysis parameters which identify a potential dam safety deficiency. Further investigations and studies are necessary.

<tr><td>hazard</td><td>Downstream Hazard Potential (Alphanumeric) Code to indicate the potential hazard to the downstream area resulting from failure or mis- operation of the dam or facilities: L for Low; S for Significant; H for High U for Undetermined. Definitions, as accepted by the Interagency Committee on Dam Safety, are as follows: 1. LOW HAZARD POTENTIAL Dams assigned the low hazard potential classification are those where failure or mis- operation results in no probable loss of human life and low economic and/or environmental losses. Losses are principally limited to the owner’s property. 2. SIGNIFICANT HAZARD POTENTIAL Dams assigned the significant hazard potential classification are those dams where failure or mis-operation results in no probable loss of human life but can cause economic loss, environment damage, disruption of lifeline facilities, or impact other concerns. Significant hazard potential classification dams are often located in predominantly rural or agricultural areas but could be located in areas with population and significant infrastructure. 3. HIGH HAZARD POTENTIAL Dams assigned the high hazard potential classification are those where failure or mis- operation will probably cause loss of human life. Hazard Potential Loss of Human Life Economic, Environmental, Lifeline Losses Classification Low None expected Low and generally limited to owner Significant None expected Yes High Probable. One or more Yes (but not necessary for this expected classification) 4. UNDETERMINED HAZARD POTENTIAL Dams for which a downstream hazard potential, as defined in 1-3 above, has not been designated or is not provided. Note that dams with a code “U” will be considered for NID inclusion the same as a dam with low hazard potential. If included in the NID, the undetermined classification will be used in publication.</td></tr>
